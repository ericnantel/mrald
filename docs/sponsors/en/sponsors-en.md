## Sponsorship <a name="top"></a>

Open source such as FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) has become an essential investment in recent decades for many companies and organizations wishing to offer better products and services. We've all used open-source technology without necessarily knowing it. This proves the need for more investment. Nowadays, users can usually rely on relatively inexpensive or even free alternatives when such a service or application becomes unusable, paid for or limited. Sometimes, it's a question of transparency that pushes users to look elsewhere.

Investing with us, with financial, material or digital support, remains a very viable option for anyone looking to offer more accessibility or wishing to further promote knowledge and also their product(s) or service(s) within the growing Open-Source community. For our part, we make sure to remain open to any proposal, respectful and compliant; Responsible; and transparent in our spending.

We don't have ideal sponsors, you all have the power to change the future of Open-Source, but here is a non-exhaustive list of sponsors who might be interested in:
* Offering an online hosting service (cloud, websites, servers)
* Offering a digital, downloadable or SaaS product (anti-virus, development tools, video games)
* Offering desktops, laptops, mobile devices or consoles 
* Offering desk accessories (monitors, keyboards, mice, headphones, cameras, microphones)
* Offering on-site conferences or available upon request
* Offering online streaming services (movies and series, gaming)
* Offering online shopping services (SMEs, marketplaces; except regulated products)
* Offering delivery services (mail or parcel, food; except regulated products)
* Offering repair services or small sales merchants of new or used electronic devices
* Offering entertaining or educational content on social media (YT channel, programming)
* Teaching programming at a recognized institution or on an online educational platform
* Enthusiastic Open-Source users

*Please write to us prior to committing to us to obtain a pre-qualification from us, based on the information you provide to us; while anyone who meets the GitHub Sponsor criteria may make a sponsorship, we reserve the right to decline any offer or proposal at any time. Note that we will do some research if the sponsorship goes further than just supporting with no expectation of a return, before giving you our verdict. It could take up to several days to get back to you. It is essential that we do this to protect ourselves and the open-source community from any ill intent or influence by certain individuals, entities, or industries.*
