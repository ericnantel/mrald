## Sponsorship

Open source such as FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) has become an essential investment in recent decades for many companies and organizations wishing to offer better products and services. We've all used open-source technology without necessarily knowing it. This proves the need for more investment to such projects.

The Mrald project (a Free Open-Source programming language) cannot survive without any funds in perpetuity. Although passionate and experienced people contribute to the project, there are still some costs associated with maintaining it. Cuts in services could be a major impediment to success, but also block access to innovation. Investing in us means offering more accessibility and promoting more knowledge of new technologies. It is also a viable and winning strategy to get more visibility to the growing Free Open-Source community for your products and services. We encourage you to use our project or help us distribute it freely, while respecting our license.

We don't have ideal sponsors, but here is a non-exhaustive list of sponsors who might be interested in:
* Offering an online hosting service (cloud, websites, servers)
* Offering a digital, downloadable or SaaS product (anti-virus, development tools, video games)
* Offering desktops, laptops, mobile devices or consoles 
* Offering desk accessories (monitors, keyboards, mice, headphones, cameras, microphones)
* Offering on-site conferences or available upon request
* Offering online streaming services (movies and series, gaming)
* Offering online shopping services (SMEs, marketplaces; except regulated products)
